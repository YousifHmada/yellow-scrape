<h5 align="center">Node.js Api to scrape yellow pages website for any given category .</h5>


## Main Modules

 this project is designed using **three drivers**
 1. **' m1 '** the **Api**
 2. **' m2 '** the **BackServer**
 3. PostgreDB hosted on cloud database as a service **[ElephantSql](https://api.elephantsql.com)**
 
<a href="https://yellow-scrape-m1.herokuapp.com/explorer/">You can find the live demo of the Project here .</a>

## How It Works
   first the api should receive a get request with the name of the category as an input and some other options
<br>then the api will make some calculations and send a post request to the **BackServer** including the name and the options required for that server to operate properly,
<br>the second server then will make requests back to the **yellow pages** website crawling all the pages of specific category through multiple or one thread as specified from the Api post request,
<br>after processing the responses came, if the Api requested **storing data** this server would send the request and **after** it will continue background calculations to store the results into the **PostgreDB**

## Api Options & User Manual
  - #### [Functions Model](https://yellow-scrape-m1.herokuapp.com/explorer/#!/functions/functions_crawl)
    this model is responsible for the crawling and different options that should be sent to the second machine
    -  name: the name of the category to be crawled.
    -  allow_deep_digging: this should be false by default and when you allow it you tell the driver to do more complex crawling and extract much deeper data.
    -  store_data: a flag to allow writing into the database.<br>
    > This call could takes much time relatively to the nubmer of pages that certain category has and the deep_digging option specified in the Api call, for example a search for **fast food** category with the deep_digging option set to true take from 40ms to 59ms, so please be patient :smiley

    this model is responsible for dealing with the database from the user perspective

## Tools & Frameworks
  -  ElephantSql@[ElephantSql.com](https://www.elephantsql.com/): ElephantSQL automates every part of setup and running of PostgreSQL clusters. Available on all major cloud and application platforms all over the world. ElephantSQL is offered by a small but stable, committed and hardworking team from Sweden. With 20,000+ running databases and several years of DBA PostgreSQL experience, we can help you with all questions you might have concerning your DB. Customers like Mr. Cooper, Blendle, and Cambridge Assessment just to mention a few, are feeling safe with us managing their DBs.
  -  LoopBack@[LoopBack.com](https://loopback.io/): LoopBack is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework that enables you to:

     * Create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs with little or no coding.
     * Access data from Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, MongoDB, SOAP and other REST APIs.
     * Incorporate model relationships and access controls for complex APIs.
     * Use built-in push, geolocation, and file services for mobile apps.
     * Easily create client apps using Android, iOS, and JavaScript SDKs.
     * Run your application on-premises or in the cloud.
  -  Express.js@[Express.js.com](https://expressjs.com/):The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.
     Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
     14 template engines via [Consolidate.js](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js),
     you can quickly craft your perfect framework.
  -  cheerio@[cheerio.com](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/edit/master/Readme.md): Cheerio parses markup and provides an API for traversing/manipulating the resulting data structure. It does not interpret the result as a web browser does. Specifically, it does *not* produce a visual rendering, apply CSS, load external resources, or execute JavaScript. If your use case requires any of this functionality, you should consider projects like [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) or [JSDom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).
  -  axios@[axios.com](https://github.com/axios/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
  -  node-postgres@[node-postgres.com](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres): Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for node.js. Pure JavaScript and optional native libpq bindings.
  -  worker-farm@[worker-farm.com](https://github.com/rvagg/node-worker-farm): Distribute processing tasks to child processes with an Ã¼ber-simple API and baked-in durability & custom concurrency options. Available in npm as **worker-farm**.
  -  body-parser@[body-parser.com](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser): Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
  -  Heroku@[Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/): Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
